# jQuery.SOAPUI: A SwaggerUI but for SOAP Services

## Description

This jQuery module spins up a web interface over the
[jquery.soap](https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap) plugin in order to
try a SOAP Web Service directly from your web browser.  

This module has only one major pre-requisite: the SOAP service has to be exposed
through an API Gateway that supports CORS.
Hopefully, [apicast](https://github.com/3scale/apicast) does !

It is intended to be used in the 3scale developer portal.
